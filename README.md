###### CO2104 HCI CW3 High-Fidelity Prototype for a Web-based Task Manager based in React.js. Originally written in March 2020.
-----------

A High-Fidelity React.js prototype of a task manager application which aims to aid users in completing tasks from their everyday lives using a "T-Shaped" design approach.

## Motivation
-----------

The motivation behind designing such a system is to improve the lives of people by organising what tasks they have to do while being mindful of why they're doing it in the first place. I have borrowed a lot of elements from the real-life Bullet Journal system, where tasks can be split up into personal or work tasks, migrated (or moved) to a future date and deleted. The Bullet Journal methodology does has a small learning curve during the beginning phases, which I have kept in mind when designing the web-based Task Manager, because my goal is to keep the system very simple and easy to use without any prior knowledge of how the system works, yet still borrow the useful and innovative elements from the Bullet Journal system.
